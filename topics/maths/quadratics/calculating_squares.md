## Completing the square

Repetition:

$f(x)=x^2-4x-6$
Notes: There has to be a $1$ before the $x^2$.
$b=-4$ -> Calculate the half, then square it, so: $b/2=-2$ -> $-2^2=4$
Then:
$f(x)=x^2-4x-6$
$f(x)=x^2-4x+4-4-6$ Note: In total, we add $0$. This is important to not change the equality.
It then allows us to use the binomal formula
$f(x)=(x-2)^2-4-6$
$f(x)=(x-2)^2-10$
