# Free Fall and Vertical Throw

## Introduction
In physics, free fall and vertical throw are two fundamental concepts related to the motion of objects in a gravitational field. This documentation provides an overview of these concepts, including the formulas and examples.

## Free Fall
Free fall refers to the motion of an object when it is only influenced by gravity. In this case, the only force acting on the object is the force of gravity, and there is no other external force affecting its motion. The acceleration due to gravity is denoted by 'g' and is approximately equal to 9.8 m/s^2 on the surface of the Earth.

### Formulas
- The distance traveled by an object in free fall can be calculated using the formula: 
    $$d = \frac{1}{2}gt^2$$
    where 'd' is the distance, 'g' is the acceleration due to gravity, and 't' is the time.

- The velocity of an object in free fall can be calculated using the formula:
    $$v = gt$$
    where 'v' is the velocity and 't' is the time.

## Vertical Throw
Vertical throw refers to the motion of an object that is thrown vertically upwards or downwards. In this case, the object is subject to both the force of gravity and an initial velocity imparted by the throw.

### Formulas
- The maximum height reached by an object in vertical throw can be calculated using the formula:
    $$h = \frac{v^2}{2g}$$
    where 'h' is the maximum height, 'v' is the initial velocity, and 'g' is the acceleration due to gravity.

- The time taken for the object to reach the maximum height can be calculated using the formula:
    $$t = \frac{v}{g}$$

- The time taken for the object to return to its initial height can be calculated using the formula:
    $$t_{total} = \frac{2v}{g}$$

## Examples
1. Free Fall:
     - An object is dropped from a height of 10 meters. Calculate the time it takes to reach the ground.
         - Given: \(d = 10\) meters, \(g = 9.8\) m/s^2
         - Using the formula \(d = \frac{1}{2}gt^2\), we can solve for 't':
             $$10 = \frac{1}{2} \times 9.8 \times t^2$$
             Solving for 't', we find \(t \approx 1.43\) seconds.

2. Vertical Throw:
     - An object is thrown vertically upwards with an initial velocity of 20 m/s. Calculate the maximum height reached.
         - Given: \(v = 20\) m/s, \(g = 9.8\) m/s^2
         - Using the formula \(h = \frac{v^2}{2g}\), we can solve for 'h':
             $$h = \frac{20^2}{2 \times 9.8}$$
             Solving for 'h', we find \(h \approx 20.41\) meters.
